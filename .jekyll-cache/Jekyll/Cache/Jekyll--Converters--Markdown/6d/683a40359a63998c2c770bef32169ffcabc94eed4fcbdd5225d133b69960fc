I"è<p>In the past week I have been busy finishing the assignments. I am now in week eight. My group and I thought together what is important to mention in the presentation and how we can best include Yung Frysk in this. We had all agreed at NHL Stenden and we have been busy making the presentation. When the presentation was finished, we went to practice in a room. We‚Äôve discussed the most important things. This is part of the ideate phase, as we are generating ideas for the presentation. It is also part of the prototype phase because the presentation is part of our prototype, and we try to see possibilities how we can best present our concept.</p>
